## 💡 Why These Updates Were Introduced

These updates were introduced to address practical gaps in how AI systems were used in real workflows.

### 1️⃣ Operator - OpenAI

🔍 **Problem:**  
AI systems were largely passive and limited to suggestions  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
Earlier models could not take actions or complete tasks  

✨ **Why this update:**  
Introduced to enable AI systems that act, execute, and complete workflows

---

### 2️⃣ o3-mini (Reasoning-Focused Model)

🔍 **Problem:**  
Reasoning models were expensive and slow  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
High costs limited real-world and large-scale usage  

✨ **Why this model:**  
Introduced to provide fast, low-cost reasoning for technical tasks

---

### 3️⃣ DeepSeek R1 (Open Source)

🔍 **Problem:**  
Strong reasoning models were mostly closed and costly  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
Limited access reduced experimentation and flexibility  

✨ **Why this model:**  
Introduced to offer powerful reasoning in an open-source, affordable form

---

### 4️⃣ Gemini 2.0 & Gemini 2.0 Flash - Google DeepMind

🔍 **Problem:**  
Multimodal models struggled with latency and long contexts  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
Earlier versions were slow and less reliable at scale  

✨ **Why this update:**  
Introduced to improve speed, context handling, and multimodal reasoning
