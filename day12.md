- Evaluation becomes as important as training
- Reliability differentiates production AI from demos

### 6️⃣ Safety, Policy & Age-Aware AI Systems Advance

- **OpenAI Model Spec updated**
- New **Under-18 (U18) Principles** introduced
- Clear boundaries for self-harm, violence, misuse and escalation
- Safety evolves from filters to system-level behavior design

### 7️⃣ AI Infrastructure & Agent Platforms Expand Quietly

- Continued rollout of agent orchestration layers (Zenflow, Nova Act)
- Agent fleets managed as infrastructure, not features
- Focus shifts from launch velocity to system resilience
- AI becomes a long-running service layer
