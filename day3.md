✨ **Why this feature:**  
Introduced to make AI interactive, editable, and collaborative in real time

---

### 3️⃣ GPT-4o Improvements

🔍 **Problem:**  
Responses often had formatting issues and unreliable code output  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
Previous versions struggled with instruction-following and consistency  

✨ **Why this update:**  
Focused on improving clarity, correctness, and collaborative usability

---

### 4️⃣ Gemini Thinking Models & Deep Research

🔍 **Problem:**  
Research workflows were slow, manual, and fragmented  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
Earlier models lacked structured planning and long-form reasoning  

✨ **Why this feature:**  
Introduced to help AI plan, reason, and synthesize information more effectively

---

### 5️⃣ Personalization, Memory & App Integrations
