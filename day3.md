### 2️⃣ Canvas

🔍 **Problem:**  
AI-generated content was hard to refine, edit, and collaborate on  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
Earlier workflows treated AI output as one-shot responses  

✨ **Why this feature:**  
Introduced to make AI interactive, editable, and collaborative in real time

---

### 3️⃣ GPT-4o Improvements

🔍 **Problem:**  
Responses often had formatting issues and unreliable code output  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
Previous versions struggled with instruction-following and consistency  

✨ **Why this update:**  
Focused on improving clarity, correctness, and collaborative usability

---

### 4️⃣ Gemini Thinking & Deep Research

🔍 **Problem:**  
Research workflows were slow, manual, and fragmented  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
Earlier models lacked structured planning and long-form reasoning  

✨ **Why this feature:**  
Introduced to help AI plan, reason, and synthesize information more effectively

---

### 5️⃣ Personalization & App Integrations

🔍 **Problem:**  
AI felt stateless and disconnected from daily user workflows  

⚠️ **Limitation:**  
Previous systems lacked memory, context, and tool awareness  

✨ **Why this feature:**  
Designed to make AI persistent, contextual, and workflow-aware
